# programming_paradigms_coursework
These are assignments I completed for my Programming Paradigms course, taught by Dr. Gashler. Assignment instructions and lectures can be found at http://gashler.com/mike/courses/. 

*Note: Assignment 5 was an optional implementation of Assignment 4 as an Android App*

## How to Run
Simply navigate to the assignment directory, run the build script, then run the compiled Java.

*The JS implementation just needs to be opened in the browser. For the multiplayer implementation, the server needs to be compiled and run.*
*Assignment 9 was written in Python 3.*
